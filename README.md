This is a repository for the students of Beyer High Schools Robotics 2 class.

Welcome Fellow Students.
This is a GitHub repository for your code.
A repository is a place where you can put your code and store all of the older and newer versions
of your code.
GitHub is very vital in the . It allows people to track the versions of their code so you
can distribute and edit the new version of code rather than operate with an outdated and/or buggy version of code.
Its a way to control the vserions of your code. Version Control.
